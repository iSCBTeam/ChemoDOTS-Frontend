Dear Bilal,
 
Sorry for my late reply but we had several deadlines to meet.

We have a local version of our server (see attached snapshot) but I don't currently have a version to share.

Our IT guy is on vacation right now and I will ask him to install it on a shared server when he returns.

Also, the server was developed under angular/nodes.js by the student but I'm not sure if this is the best option.
Unfortunately, I don't have the manpower at the moment to develop a new version.

Regarding the Galaxy server (https://chemodots.marseille.inserm.fr), the license has expired.

Would it be possible to renew this license? I don't remember exactly which license is needed.

All the best

Philippe
